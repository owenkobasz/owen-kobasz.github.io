# My Portfolio Site

Hi! This is my personal portfolio website. You can check it out live at [owenkobasz.com](https://owenkobasz.com).

## What's This About?

I built this site to showcase my work as a software engineer. It's a pretty straightforward portfolio—you'll find info about me, some projects I've worked on, and a way to get in touch. Nothing too fancy, but I'm happy with how it turned out.

The site itself is built with vanilla JavaScript, Webpack, and Sass. I went with a simple stack because honestly, sometimes the simplest solution is the best one. Plus, I wanted to keep things fast and lightweight.

## Features

- **Animated canvas backgrounds** - I added some connecting dots animations because I thought they looked cool
- **Typed.js integration** - The hero section cycles through different roles I identify with
- **EmailJS contact form** - So people can actually reach out without me having to manage a backend
- **Responsive design** - Works on mobile, tablet, desktop... you know, the usual

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (vanilla, no framework needed for this)
- Webpack for bundling
- Sass for styling
- HTML5 canvas for those background animations
- EmailJS for the contact form

## Getting Started

If you want to run this locally (maybe you're curious about how I built it, or you want to fork it for your own portfolio), here's how:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

That's it! The dev server will start up and you can see the site at `http://localhost:8080` (or whatever port Webpack assigns).

## Projects Featured

Right now I'm showcasing two main projects:

1. **Cyclone** - An AI-powered cycling route generator. I'm a cyclist, so this was a fun one to build. It uses GPT to understand natural language route requests and generates GPX files for your bike computer.

2. **Turbo** - A used car market insights tool that scrapes Craigslist and enriches listings with VIN data. Built this to help people make better car-buying decisions.

## A Bit About Me

I'm a software engineer with a bit of an unconventional background. I studied liberal arts at St. John's College (the great books program) before making the switch to tech. Before that, I worked in the fine art world as a gallery director and curator, which taught me a lot about project management and communication.

These days I'm building web applications that often involve AI and machine learning. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me on my bike, taking photos, or somewhere outdoors.

## License

This is my personal portfolio, so feel free to look around and get inspired, but please don't just copy it wholesale. If you want to use parts of it, that's cool—just make it your own.
