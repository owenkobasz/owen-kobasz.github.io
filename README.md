# My Portfolio Site

Hi! This is my personal portfolio website. You can check it out live at [owenkobasz.com](https://owenkobasz.com).

I built this site to showcase my work as a software engineer. It's a pretty straightforward portfolio—you'll find info about me, some projects I've worked on, and a way to get in touch.

The site itself is built with vanilla JavaScript, Webpack, and Sass. I went with a simple stack because honestly, sometimes the simplest solution is the best one. Plus, I wanted to keep things fast and lightweight.

## Features

- **Animated canvas backgrounds**
- **Typed.js integration**
- **EmailJS contact form**
- **Responsive design**

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (vanilla, no framework needed for this)
- Webpack for bundling
- Sass for styling
- HTML5 canvas for background animations
- EmailJS for the contact form

## Projects Featured

Right now I'm showcasing two main projects:

1. **Cyclone** - An AI-powered cycling route generator. I'm a cyclist, so this was a fun one to build. It uses GPT to understand natural language route requests and generates GPX files for your bike computer.

2. **Turbo** - A used car market insights tool that scrapes Craigslist and enriches listings with VIN data. Built this to help people make better car-buying decisions.

## A Bit About Me

I'm a software engineer with a bit of an unconventional background. I studied liberal arts at St. John's College (the great books program) before making the switch to tech. Before that, I worked in the fine art world as a gallery director and curator, which taught me a lot about project management and communication.

These days I'm building web applications that often involve AI and machine learning. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me on my bike, taking photos, or somewhere outdoors.
