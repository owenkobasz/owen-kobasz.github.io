I’ve been meaning to start a blog for a while, and it felt like a good excuse to redesign my site.

Historically, this has been a straightforward portfolio (to prove that I can, in fact, code and work with modern web frameworks, etc.). But recently I’ve been increasingly inspired by the indie web movement and the care individuals put into their personal sites. There’s a lot I’d still like to change about the current iteration, but I se it as a process of becoming. Completed projects are great (and impressive), but the problem-solving phase is where I have the most fun.

Through this blog, I hope to share and develop ideas around the things I find interesting and inspiring: AI (done right), philosophy, bikes, computers, and the great outdoors. Those who know me personally know that I like to geek out on the details and sit with the ambiguous spaces between right and wrong, known and unknown. Currently my philosophy is to do that which promotes life and build human connections whenever possible.
